==========

The story
---------

The story take place in the future. Tired of the civilisation, you decided to retire to a distant world.
You bought a new discovered planet in your local planet selling agency.

The dealer made a good price on a paradisiac planet with beautiful landscape with islands, sandy beaches, palm forest and a beautiful blue sky.
The catalog showed a friendly world populated of peacefull animals.

You take your new ship and go through the long journey.
During the trip, you dreamed of your new world.
And finaly, after a year of boring travell you reached the orbit and started the landing procedure.

Infortunately, you hit an asteroid that was not on the map and your ship was heavily damaged.
The ship wasn't controllable anymore and finally you crashed on your planet.

By chance, you still alive, but most of your equipment and materials was destroyed.

As soon as you looked around you, your realized that the planet wasn't what the dealer promised to you.

What a strange and desolated world with a black sky and strange luminous blocks !!!

All what you see is uncommon and you know nothing about it...

As you look on your personal digital assistant, you noticed you received an important email that arrived using powerfull long distance intergalactic emitters: the agency said that they may have made a mistake because someone confused planet data files.
They said that in the eventuality you remain alive, the sales contract did not mention the details of the surface of the planet, and infortunately, they can't made any exchange and refund.

But before you can do something, you have no choice: you have no intergalactic ship to escape and no suitable communication equipment to query some help.

What you will do now is up to you...

The game
--------

Blackvoxel is a new sandbox game based on a voxel engine.

Developpment started in Aug. 2010 as a hobby research project because we wanted to play with voxel based paradigms.
With time, the bunch of code slowly became a true game project.

The game is written in C/C++ programming langage using OpenGL and running on Linux and Windows operating system.

~~MacOs version may be planed in the future if users loves it...~~ *(It may be implemented in the original repo first)*

Compile Blackvoxel from source
==============================

Here are informations for compiling and running Blackvoxel from source.

For version 1.\*: Don't forget to report any difficulty and errors in the [forum](http://forum.blackvoxel.com/) in the troubleshooting section.

If you've made a port of Blackvoxel or compiled it for an unlisted (or
not yet supported) platform, we would be happy to get feedback to
improve this tutorial.
*Warning with which version you are using: this fork is implementing some tools that the original repo doesn't.*

Linux
-----

###### **/!\ This will compile version 1.\*:**

Compiling and running blackvoxel with most Linux distributions is very
simple.

See bellow for per-distro step-by-step instructions.

If you want to go further, modify and debug, we recommend using [Eclipse
CDT](https://www.eclipse.org/cdt/).

### Ubuntu

1. Download source tarball (.tar.bz2 source archive) [here](http://blackvoxel.com/view.php?node=1541) and put it in your home directory
2. Open a terminal type: "term" in ubuntu lancher or press 'ctrl-alt-t'
3. Enter the following commands:
```
    sudo apt-get install build-essential libglew-dev libsdl1.2-dev
    tar -xjvf blackvoxel_source*
    cd blackvoxel_source*
    make
```

Once build succeded, you can launch Blackvoxel with the following command:

    cd ~/blackvoxel_source* && ./blackvoxel

### Debian

1. Download source tarball (.tar.bz2 source archive) [here](http://blackvoxel.com/view.php?node=1541) and put it in your home directory
2. Open a terminal:
-   Open the activity menu
-   Type "terminal" on the "type to search" field at the right of the
    screen.
-   Click on the "terminal" (not the "root terminal") icon.
3. Enter the following commands :
```
    sudo apt-get install build-essential libglew-dev libsdl1.2-devexit
    tar -xjvf blackvoxel_source*
    cd blackvoxel_source*
    make
```

Once build succeded, you can launch Blackvoxel with the following
command:

    cd ~/blackvoxel_source* && ./blackvoxel

### openSUSE

    sudo zypper in gcc-c++ glew-devel libSDL-devel
    tar -xf blackvoxel_source*
    make
    ./blackvoxel

### PCLinuxOS

    sudo apt-get install gcc-c++ libglew-devel libSDL-devel
    tar -xf blackvoxel_source*
    make
    ./blackvoxel

### Manjaro

    sudo pacman -S base-devel glew1.10 sdl
    tar xf blackvoxel_source*
    make
    ./blackvoxel

### Other Linux distributions

Blackvoxel can be compiled in debian and ubuntu derived (like Mint) in
the same ways described above.

For non debian distributions, you'll have to find the exact way using
the following indications:

-   Install the gcc with g++ compiler, linker, tools and headers.
-   Find and Install equivalent packages for required libraries with the
    package manager in your Linux Distribution.

We hope to add distributions to this list with time.

### Non Linux various Unix...

No attempt to compile Blackvoxel on other unixes has been done at this
time. In theory, it should work with minimal adaptations.

Anyway, you need to have hardware 3D OpenGL support to run Blackvoxel.

###### This will compile the last version:

### Ubuntu

1. Open a terminal type: "term" in ubuntu lancher or press 'ctrl-alt-t'
2. Enter the following commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/rajdakin/Blackvoxel.git
cd Blackvoxel
sudo apt-get install build-essential libglew-dev libsdl1.2-dev cmake
cmake .
```
3. Wait until it's done
4. Type ```make all```

Once build succeded, you can launch Blackvoxel with the following command:
```
cd ~/Blackvoxel && ./blackvoxel
```

### Debian

1. Open a terminal:
-   Open the activity menu
-   Type "terminal" on the "type to search" field at the right of the
    screen.
-   Click on the "terminal" (not the "root terminal") icon.
2. Enter the following commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/rajdakin/Blackvoxel.git
cd Blackvoxel
sudo apt-get install build-essential libglew-dev libsdl1.2-dev cmake
cmake .
```
3. Wait until it's done
4. Type ```make all```

Once build succeded, you can launch Blackvoxel with the following command:
```
cd ~/Blackvoxel && ./blackvoxel
```

### Other Linux distribution

It might be the same as the other distributions:
1. Open a terminal whichever way
2. Enter the following commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/rajdakin/Blackvoxel.git
cd Blackvoxel
sudo apt-get install build-essential libglew-dev libsdl1.2-dev cmake
cmake .
```
3. Wait until it's done
4. Type ```make all```

Once build succeded, you can launch Blackvoxel with the following command:
```
cd ~/Blackvoxel && ./blackvoxel
```

### Non Linux various Unix...

No attempt to compile Blackvoxel on other unixes has been done at this
time. In theory, it should work with minimal adaptations.

Anyway, you need to have hardware 3D OpenGL support to run Blackvoxel.

Windows
-------

Version 2.\*:
You must use CMake to compile BlackVoxel.
Unfortunately, I don't know how to do with Windows.

Version 1.\*:
Infortunately, building Blackvoxel in Windows isn't as simple as in
Linux because lacking of an equivalent software package management
system.

So, it will be harder than in Linux if your aren't realy accustomed with
programming.

Here is what you need to get for compiling Blackvoxel in Window

-   The [mingw](http://www.mingw.org/) gcc compiler suite.
-   Download and compile the following libraries : freeglut, glew,
    libsdl.
-   [Eclipse CDT](https://www.eclipse.org/cdt/) developpment IDE
    (Optionnal).

We have tested successfully the tools listed here for the Windows
version.

Compilation with other developpement tools is untested.

MacOs X
-------

At current time, Blackvoxel hasn't been ported to MacOs (We don't own
any Mac).

Some programmers told us it should work with minimal effort.
We'll post any solution as soon as someone would publish it.
Stay tuned with the forum.
